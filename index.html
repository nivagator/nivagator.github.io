	<h1>Hi there. It's Gavin.</h1>
	<p>The Internet knows me as <strong>Nivagator</strong>. Don't be fooled. I can totally spell 'navigator' correctly. This is way cooler than that.</p>
	<p>Its my name backwards (nivag) plus "ator", as in <em>The Termin<strong>ator</strong></em>.</p>
	<p>See? Way cooler.</p>
